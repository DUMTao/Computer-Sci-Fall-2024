# What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
radius = 5**3

# 2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. 
# Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 
# What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?

print(f' The total wholesale cost for 60 copies is: {(price_per_book * 60) + 3 + (shipping_after1 * 59)}  ')

# 3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), 
# then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, 
# what time do I get home for breakfast?
