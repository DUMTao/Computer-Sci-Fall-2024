Goal: Visualize data using pandas and matplotlib

Step 1: Download james_bond_data_cleansed.csv from Canvas and save it in a folder on your
computer (e.g. CSC2280 Project 2)

Step 2: Create a jupyter notebook in VSCode. Save the notebook in the same folder in Step 1.

Step 3: Import pandas and matplotlib and use pd.read_csv() to read from the
james_bond_data_cleansed.csv file
